Project Overview: Chat Application with Role-Based Access

We are developing a chat application designed with role-based access control to manage team communication efficiently. The application features four distinct roles: Admin, Project Manager, Assistant, and Employee.

Admin: The Admin has the highest level of access, including managing users, configuring system settings, and overseeing the entire application.
Project Manager: The Project Manager oversees project-related communication, assigns tasks, and monitors progress within the chat environment.
Assistant: The Assistant supports the Project Manager by managing schedules, organizing meetings, and handling communication logistics.
Employee: The Employee role is designed for team members who focus on project execution and contribute to discussions within their assigned tasks.
This structure ensures that communication and project management are streamlined, with each role having specific permissions tailored to their responsibilities.
